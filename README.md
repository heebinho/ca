# Static Code Analysis


Static code analysis is an important building block in the Secure Development Lifecycle. What are the challenges in static code analysis and can a source code analyzer be delib-erately deceived to introduce a known vulnerability into a code repository?
A weak point analysis was used to find basic challenges. Based on this, concepts were derived on how to bypass a selected analyzer. These concepts were tested for suitability by a PoC.
The weak point analysis showed, that complexity is the greatest challenge of static code analysis. The PoC showed that three of the four concepts had an immediate effect and could deceive the chosen analyzer.
Static code analysis is an important building block in the Secure Development Lifecycle but not a silver bullet. Rules, metrics and algorithms must be constantly questioned and further developed.
